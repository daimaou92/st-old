## SIMPLE TERMINAL
As described [here](https://st.suckless.org/)

[This](https://git.suckless.org/st/commit/f1546cf9c1f9fc52d26dbbcf73210901e83c7ecf.html) is the lastest commit at the time of cloning.

Patches applied
1. alpha
2. scrollback
3. xresources
4. clipboard
5. anysize
6. palettes

The goal was to go with the idea that suckless tries to propagate while, personally, trying to have a terminal emulator not practically useless in lieu of sticking literally to said principles. The above patches are the minimum I cannot do without. Hence this repo.

Absolutely no other changes have been made.

Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/daimaou92/st.git
cd st
sudo make clean install
```
